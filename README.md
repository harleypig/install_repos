## install_repos
Install repositories for your RedHat based OS.

### Why?
I got tired of having to track down, download and then install keys and rpms
or download files. This automates much of that.

### ...
This was developed using CentOS over the course of the last few years and is
tailored to my specific needs.

I'm quite willing to accept pull requests--that's why I made this public.

I hope you get as much use out of it as I do.

### Usage
  install_repos list
  install_repos repo1 repo2
  install_repos [-a|--all] [-e|--except repo1 repo2]
